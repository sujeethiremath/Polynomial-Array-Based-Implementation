# Polynomial-Array-Based-Implementation
For each pair of input lines, program evaluates the polynomial for all the values of x (x0 through xm) and outputs the resulting values on a single line.

Input

The program accepts an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent one problem. The first line
will contain a list of n + 1 numbers a(n), a(nâˆ’1), . . . , a2, a1, a0 which represent a set of coefficients to a polynomial expression.
The order of the polynomial is n.
The second line of text are the m + 1 values x0, x1, . . . , xm to be used for x when evaluating the polynomial.
Input will be redirected from standard input.

Sample Input

-2

5 0 1 6

1 -1

7 6 -1

Output

For each pair of lines, the program evaluates the polynomial for all the values of x (x0 through xm) and outputs the
resulting values on a single line.
Output is sent to standard output.

Sample Output

-2 -2 -2 -2

6 5 -2
